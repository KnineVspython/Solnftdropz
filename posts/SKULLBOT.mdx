About:
•Skullbot Biker Gang is community driven project where players use the basic building blocks, a Böt, to build everything in hell. Complete missions for Lucifer to get Bolts and have Mulciber, Satan’s blacksmith, forge your demon.

•As you move up the hierarchical ladder of Hell you become master of your realm and hold command over all lesser Demons. Once a Lord is declared he gains command of his gang and all those within his realm. Lords hold the power to lead their gangs to prosperity or their ultimate demise.

•The Lord of Lords will sit beside Lucifer sharing in all of his riches. Together they hold all 6.9 realms of hell within their command.

Roadmap:

Phase 1 – NFT Strategy Game
•Players get their game pieces
•3 Generations of Skullbots each with varying in-game Utility
•HellDAO is formed

Phase 2 – Let the games begin
•Stake your Skullbots for $bolt
•DegenDevil is fired up
•Use your $bolt to get Summons.
•Many ways to do this, but only the most strategic players will be granted the most Summons
•How to Get Summon?
•DegenDevil
•Dex
•Giveaways
•Flash Sales
•Liquidity Program

Phase 3 – The Demons
•Demons will have access to a Second LP much larger than the $Bolt LP
•Exclusive Raffles, Auctions and Giveaways for Demons only
•Demons get the $$$

Phase 4 – A real DAO
•Vote and participate in real business decisions as a global brand is formed
•Brand expansion to include:
•Merch Store
•Tattoo Shop
•Skullbot NFT Comics

Phase 5 – Skullbots Metaverse
•A globally recognized brand backed by VC funding.
•As the Skullbots Demon collection is unlocked our team will begin development of the Skullbots Metaverse.

Risk: 2.5/5
•A 2.5/5 risk rating shows the project has exhibited real demand in the short or long term potential and in its current iteration has a very viable chance to see both short and potentially long term success if executed on correctly.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
