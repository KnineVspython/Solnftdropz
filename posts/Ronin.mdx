About:
‚Ä¢We are RONINS. Though we have no lord or master, we still have a duty to ourselves and to those around us. We fight for glory. We fight for greatness. But most importantly, we fight for our honor as well as that of all Ronins.

‚Ä¢To whomever that has yet to step foot in the Dojo, stay focused on the Portal. Do not miss the Portal. Rise above all and join our Ronin frens on the journey of ascension. Stay focused on the Portal.

Roadmap:

Phase 1 - Community
‚Ä¢Every great project relies on a greater community, which is why we have started by establishing trust between the team and the community.
Building the Ronin community was and will always be our first goal, as we all share this passion of becoming ronins and frenz along the way. This phase will keep evolving before and after the mint.

‚Ä¢You should know that this phase will keep evolving before and after the mint.

Phase 2 - Staking & Future Utilities
‚Ä¢Making a choice and acquiring an NFT most typically comes after extensive research, and that is why we have made many efforts to satisfy our community‚Äôs needs. Speaking of which, our project will have a basic staking system, but we are not making it a unique source for passive income. The staking will also allow every holder the chance to acquire the $YUMI token, which will give him/her access to a variety of benefits such as taking part in the upcoming game.

Ronin Studios - Game Dev Studio
‚Ä¢We have worked hard to make this project come to fruition, and with our plans getting bigger and more complex, one of our ambitions has revolved around the game development scene. With that in mind, the team has decided to introduce: Ronin Studios ¬©Ô∏è, our own game development company. We see this step fit especially with our upcoming P2E Card Game, and also with ambitions to make other games in the near future and expand to work with bigger studios.

P2E Card Game - More Utilities
‚Ä¢Following the previous announcement regarding Ronin Studios ¬©Ô∏è, we would like to let you in on our plan to make a P2E card game. The game is a work in progress in its very early stages. We‚Äôre currently discussing the themes, game modes, P2E styles, game economics and so on and so forth. We are so eager to deliver this project in the most elegant way, and we believe we are on the right path. We will be opening a channel for suggestions, and that is for the community to let us know about things they might want to see in this upcoming game.

Risk: 3.5/5
A 3.5/5 risk rating indicates the project shows potential and a QF play may be possible if hype converts into buying pressure. Only in time with the long term proposition and roadmap being developed will the true value be known.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
