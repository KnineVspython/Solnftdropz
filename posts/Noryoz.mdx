About:
‚Ä¢N≈çryoz is an exclusive collection of 2222 NFTs on Solana that grants its members an experience to The Clan. Along with weekly Solana airdrops, exclusive members channel, Web 3.0 career prospects and Alpha Hunts! N≈çryoz comes with the full package and more!

‚Ä¢The core values of the N≈çryoz Community are the key to a scintillating future. As we continue to evolve, we strive to ensure our values and culture are strong and well to achieve the ideal community our founders have envisioned.


Roadmap:

The Temple
‚Ä¢Send your N≈çryoz to The Temple to pay obeisance to the deities and seek enlightenment for spiritual expansion.

‚Ä¢As the N≈çryoz attains peace within, its presence vanishes and becomes one with the earth.

‚Ä¢During its canonical hours, enlightened N≈çryoz are rewarded with $NORY, a gift from the deities.

‚Ä¢$NORY will be the main currency used to fuel the N≈çryoz ecosystem.

The Fortune Store
‚Ä¢The Fortune Store will implement $NORY as its native currency and enable token holders to trade their $NORY for goods.

‚Ä¢The Store will pivot riches in the form of exclusive whitelists, Auctions, Raffles, Lotteries, Merchandise, and so on.


The Alpha Hunters
‚Ä¢A team of experienced Alpha Hunters will be formed to provide internal information on upcoming projects, mints and secure whitelist spots for The Clan.

‚Ä¢Nothing is beyond their talent as they fearlessly conquer the challenges in their path and
constantly provide value to their fellow clan members.


Web 3.0 Job Services
‚Ä¢Looking to advance your career in Web 3.0? For Clan Members interested in exploring work prospects in this ever-expanding industry, the N≈çryoz Clan will be building a special aggregation app for Web 3.0 Job Postings.

‚Ä¢Whether you are seeking for a career as an analyst, backend engineer, or community manager, you've come to the right community. Prepare your CV, and apply right away!

Risk: 3/5
-A 3/5 risk rating shows the project shows level of potential but there are still things that need to be seen to make sure long term success exists in its current state and only with existing hype converting into stable buying pressure a QF will be possible

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
