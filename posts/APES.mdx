About:
Trippin' Ape Tribe is a community-first PFP project on Solana, backed by strong and ownable branding, cheeky storytelling, innovative long-term utility, and a passionate community of free-thinking degens.

10,000 Apes have fallen under the trance of a mysterious yet charismatic leader, Chorles, but don’t worry… it's definitely not a cult.

Roadmap:
THERE ARE NO ROADMAPS WHERE WE’RE GOING....


Principles

Community
It may not be a cult, but we did set out to build the most tight-knit, empowered community on Solana. Everything we do — from our branding choices to our utilities to the way we reveal details about the project — has been carefully engineered to build hype, drive engagement, and create opportunities for the Tribe to connect deeply. We believe in strength in numbers. Apes ascend as one.

Identity
An important part of building a powerful cult…ure is knowing what we are and what we aren’t. Trippin’ Ape Tribe is a community built by and for free-thinking degens. By embracing our true nature, we welcome in genuine creative inspiration and new strategic partnerships with like-minded brands and collaborators that can all spread the mission further.

Innovation
Thanks to Chorles and his infinite wisdom, our consciousness continues to expand, illuminating possibilities where once we only saw limits. We will continue to bring big-brain thinking and next-level utilities to the project to keep our Tribe guessing and the Solana ecosystem moving forward. Trust the process.

Risk: 1.5/5
•A 1.5/5 risk means the project exhibits an overwhelming amount of demand in the short term paired with an exceptional vision for both short and long term success.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
