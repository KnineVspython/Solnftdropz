About:
‚Ä¢Moonly was created to help make it easier to understand what projects to get involved in the Solana NFT space. If you search ‚ÄúNFT rug‚Äù it‚Äôs clear why a service that can help minimize risk is critical. Beyond the outright scams, many projects fail in this space.

Moonly will
‚Ä¢Perform social media audits to help judge if the hype is real or it‚Äôs just a bunch of bots
‚Ä¢Monitor marketplaces to track floor price, volume, number of listed, etc.
‚Ä¢Provide alerts if an NFT you‚Äôre tracking goes above or below a price you set
‚Ä¢Buy or sell for you automatically based on criteria you set
‚Ä¢Analyze the blockchain for smart-money and whale watching behavior
‚Ä¢Send you reminders about upcoming mint days you‚Äôre interested in
‚Ä¢Be accessed via a Chrome extension and mobile app.

Roadmap:

We built
‚Ä¢Moonly v1 prototype - upcoming NFT aggregator for Solana
‚Ä¢Moonly v2 that brings new features below 
‚Ä¢Social stats checker - check daily growth of Discord and Twitter, up/down trends for any NFT project in our database
‚Ä¢Monitoring market data like FP, listed number, volume, 24h, 7days trends, and more
‚Ä¢Charts and visualizations Auto-update for market data - get a sound notification anytime there is a change in market data for an NFT project you‚Äôre watching. No more manual page refreshing!
‚Ä¢Alerts - get alert notifications when certain conditions are met (ex. ‚Äúalert me when DeGods floor price goes above 100 SOL‚Äù)
‚Ä¢NFT pixel art - we partnered with a great designer to create beautiful art for Moonly
Moonly explainer video for promotion and collaboration

Plan to build
‚Ä¢Mint manager - a better place to manage projects and whitelists. ( ex. a mint reminder will notify you multiple times before an important mint happens)
‚Ä¢Portfolio management - track, manage and get automated alerts notifications when there are big movements in collections you hold
‚Ä¢Mobile app - Moonly‚Äôs web app is already mobile-friendly, but converting to a mobile app gives a better user experience and it's just a few taps away
‚Ä¢More blockchains - since we have our framework ready, we‚Äôll add other major blockchains that have a solid NFT economy (ex. Ethereum, Cardano, Near, Terra)
‚Ä¢Discord bots and tools that will be used by NFT projects - since most of the actions are happening on Discord, it's important to have the right tools to help founders run communities better
‚Ä¢Browser add-on/extension for Chrome, Firefox, Brave - this add-on will bring you Moonly analytical data and tools while you‚Äôre visiting marketplaces, Twitter, and other sites, so you can always have data on the go
‚Ä¢Wallet tracker - see where the "smart money" or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù go so you can discover projects worth investing in
‚Ä¢Automations aka bots  - we‚Äôre talking about the good ones that do no harm, not minting bots
‚Ä¢NFT sniper tool - which will use the power of automation to catch the good opportunities automatically
‚Ä¢Our own RPC - for on-chain analysis without the limitation of third-party (think of SSC or Node Monkey)
‚Ä¢NFT burner - similar to NFTabs, you burn/merge 2 or more Moonly NFTs into 1 to get access to premium features and benefits
And many more things that will come from the need and natural evolution of the NFT space

Risk: 3/5
‚Ä¢A 3/5 risk rating shows the project shows level of potential but there are still things that need to be seen to make sure long term success exists in its current state and only with existing hype converting into stable buying pressure a QF will be possible.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
