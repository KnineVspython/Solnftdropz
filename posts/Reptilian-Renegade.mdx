About:
•A collective of 4,000 evolved, unique, intelligent, and misunderstood lizards roaming around the #Solana ecosystems’ meadows.

•We want to build a project which has it all to offer, and gives our community the best of all worlds.
​
•We want to be innovative, and yet use inspiration from the same formulas many successful projects have and will continue to use as time goes on.

Roadmap:

Vague Roadmap?

•For too long, there's always been one project for this, and one project for that.
•But why is there no project that has it all to offer?
•Why does it have to be a dope community or dope devs?
•Why does it have to be amazing art or an amazing roadmap?
•Why does it have to be part of the meta or innovative?
•Why do we have to make a choice?
•We want our roadmap to be vague because we want to under promise and overdeliver.

Risk: 3.5/5
A 3.5/5 risk rating indicates the project shows potential and a QF play may be possible if hype converts into buying pressure. Only in time with the long term proposition and roadmap being developed will the true value be known.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
