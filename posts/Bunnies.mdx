About:
•You ever wondered what life would be like as a self-aware bunny? Well, Hoptropolis is home to 7575 of them, and it’s a blast. Their world is powered by the Solana blockchain – because SOL is hot af. If you find yourself bouncing with excitement, then bounce right on over here – because it’s about to get good.

Roadmap:

Initial Launch
•We'll launch our collection of 7575 Bunnies N Homies NFTs, and implement a holder verification system. Following a successful sellout, we'll launch our staking platform and create a DAO for future utility. We'll also introduce our $VIBEZ token, and begin preparation for its rollout.

Royalty Distribution
•Royalties will be split into two categories, both ensuring the long-term success of the project.
• 50% of the royalties will go into a liquidity pool, which will be used to maintain the value of $VIBEZ
•50% of the royalties will go to the community wallet, which will be governed by holders using our DAO.

Collaboration & Growth
•Our marketing team will be continuously making sure that our social media remains up-to-date, and that we maintain constant output. Our efforts will be combined with an effective marketing campaign, and a range of top-level collaborations to ensure that our project keeps growing, and the hype continues to build.

•As a part of our growth, we'll also offer continuous giveaways to keep our community happy.

$VIBEZ Rollout
•Our exclusive $VIBEZ token will be made available to holders, and allow them to take part in a range of activities, such as:
•Purchasing merchandise from our merch store
• Participate in raffles to win bluechip NFTs
•Mutate your NFT (details to be confirmed  )
• Even more utility TBA

The Future
•The future of our project can be found in the Metaverse, in the form of our Bunnies N Homies Mansion. This will be a social space initially, and a place for holders to connect and take part in games and events.

Risk: 3/5
-A 3/5 risk rating shows the project shows level of potential but there are still things that need to be seen to make sure long term success exists in its current state and only with existing hype converting into stable buying pressure a QF will be possible

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
