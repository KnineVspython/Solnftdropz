About:
•Presidential Peanuts is the nuttiest NFT project on the Solana blockchain, and we offer quite a lot more than unique visuals and the hopes of a united community. Our project comes to the aid of an NFT community that is starved of exciting utility, as well as a starving society that doesn't have access to a basic human requirement: food. We’ve managed to perfectly merge a creative and fun project, with a crucial message.

•The Presidential Peanuts is an NFT brand and collection of 4,444 eclectic and customizable NFTs.
When you invest in a Peanut, you're not just buying a profile pic or a digital piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a community whose benefits and offerings will increase as the success of the project increases. Your Peanut can serve as your digital identity and open digital doors for you (even IRL come to think of it).


Roadmap:

Part 1

Start of the Project
•We’ll start with the creation of our NFTs, and kick-start our marketing efforts to set up key partnerships with other collections. Teamwork makes the dream work!

•The real non-fungible fun starts once our website goes live, when we’ll be offering a host of giveaways and airdrops, and ready to commence our next step.

Create your Candidate
•Straight after mint, we’ll launch Nutkit and release the rarity ranking so you can see how you’ve done.

•The collection will also be listed on the secondary marketplaces along with the integration of sales bot to Discord and Twitter, and Matrica verification for holders.

Serve 4444 Meals
•Give back to families and children across the world through sharethemeal.org

Solrewards
•Seed Community Fund with 250 SOL for partnerships, hires, & marketing campaigns off the back of a successful mint

Part 2

Crackdown Begins
•Begin to weed out the disloyal peanuts by scouring the marketplace to find the deserters to buy and burn (capped at 444). Plus, launch Peanuterry, a place where the fallen Peanuts are commemorated… not.

Nutdrops and Merch
•Airdrop high-value NFTs to lucky holders, and launch exclusive merch - because what’s the point of owning a snack if you can’t look like one?

Part 3

The Presidential Race
•The 1st election cycle begins through a series of games and events pitting four parties against each other. Launch Hall of Fame Leaderboard.

Inauguration Day
•Inauguration day will see one Presidential Peanut crowned the victor which marks the beginning of 'their term' as part of the team. Launch of the Control Room.

DAO and Treasury
•Setup an on-chain governance interface to enable the community to initiate and vote on decisions on how funds are allocated. Minor decisions will be voted on by the DAO, while Majors ones will involve the team.


Long-Term Vision
•Focus on exceptional storytelling/community to develop an exceptional brand
•Continuously innovate and deliver fun new features/experiences
•Develop reward programs that offer financial incentives to our holders
•Expand our world into many different mediums (books? games?)
•Diversify our revenue stream, not be so dependent on secondary NFT sales

Risk: 3.5/5
•A 3.5/5 risk rating indicates the project shows potential and a QF play may be possible if hype converts into buying pressure. Only in time with the long term proposition and roadmap being developed will the true value be known.

**1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest***
