About:
‚Ä¢We are the 1.69%. Not just a regular NFT collection but a movement that stands by the words 'fck regulation'.

‚Ä¢A collection of 6969 ReGuLaToRs that can‚Äôt be controlled and are determined to outrun regulation. The Solana blockchain will be ReGuLaTeD.

Staking
‚Ä¢Stake your NFTs to earn $FREE. $FREE is going to be used to customize your Regulated NFTs, purchase ads on our podcast by third parties, mint our future drops, get WL spots and more.

RegulatedCast
‚Ä¢Our decentralised podcast, driven by our community. Holders will vote on guests, topics and questions via our DAO and will benefit from the revenue generated by the podcast through ads and sponsors.

Animated Series
‚Ä¢The long-term goal of the project is the create, monetise and maintain an animated comedy series - with your NFTs along for the ride.


Roadmap:

25%
‚Ä¢The foundations of the #FREE ecosystem will emerge as we jump start our cause of escaping regulation. ReGuLaTeD NFT's will enter the web3 narrative and will become available on marketplaces such as Magic Eden and Solanart

‚Ä¢Our staking platform will open its doors and allow our holders to passively earn $FREE tokens

‚Ä¢Our DAO will be set-up where we will provide whitelist spots, alpha & allow the community to have an impact on the growth and future of ReGuLaTeD

‚Ä¢Shortly after the mint, our decentralized podcast will be begin production.

50%
‚Ä¢While everyone is accumulating $FREE, the plans of rebellion will carry on as we start broadcasting our decentralized podcast: RegulatedCast

‚Ä¢Out community will vote on the guests, topics and questions as we explore all the latestbeep bop boop* in the web3 space, Solana and beyond. The voting will be carried out via our DAO and will be exclusive to our NFT holders. RegulatedCast will be driven by our community of holders, made for the world to enjoy.

‚Ä¢Beyond having a say in the content, our holders will benefit from the revenue generated by the podcast via sponsorships and advertising. This will be distributed to those who stake and take part in voting.

‚Ä¢RegulatedCast is made with the vision of pushing the boundaries of what decentralized communities can achieve.


75%
‚Ä¢ReGuLaTeD holders will be receiving a range of mystery NFT airdrops made up of studios and upgrade packages.

‚Ä¢Those who receive a Studio will be able to rent it out for a fee and give their occupants the temporary abelites to vote in the RegulatedCast DAO. This will create an incentive for the general audiences of the podcast who not have a ReGuLaTeD NFT to take part in shaping the future of the production and give further value to holders

‚Ä¢Upgrade packs will also be airdropped to our community, giving their recipients the chance to customize their own NFT's and increase their yield when staking
(Note: Only ReGuLaTeD NFT holders will be able to submit items for voting. Those who rent a studio will only be able to vote on already proposed items.)

100%
‚Ä¢The ReGuLaTeD Series begins production, ready for the big screen well before the next halving.

Risk: 3.5/5
‚Ä¢A 3.5/5 risk rating indicates the project shows potential and a QF play may be possible if hype converts into buying pressure. Only in time with the long term proposition and roadmap being developed will the true value be known.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
