About:
•Degen Islands a play-to-earn metaverse built on the Solana blockchain.

•Users can purchase their own islands and then enter a Minecraft-style metaverse to mine their land, collect materials and resources, and then build, craft, farm, stake and rent to earn $NUGGETS and $DGOLD

•Think: Decentraland x Minecraft + Solana

•Our vision is to make the most accessible and fun P2E game on any blockchain.

Risk: 3/5
•A 3/5 risk rating Indicates the project shows a level of potential but there are still things that need to be seen to make sure long term success exists in its current state and only with existing hype converting into stable buying pressure a QF will be possible.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
