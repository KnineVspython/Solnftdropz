1. Your first few trades will SUCK. Don't overinvest at first. Make bets on proven projects. Were adding a mirror so you can see what trades are happing and what people are looking for because data is everything Degenz.

2. New Projects are literally just opportunities to accumulate more SOL but that doesn't mean you have to invest in RUGS OR SCAMS. Flip good projects ran by good teams.

3. You have no idea what the fuck you're doing. Don't chase rarity they're illiquid in most collections.

4. BUT LET'S SAY YOU WANT TO SLING YOUR D\*\*\* AROUND. Buy Gold. Always Buy Gold.

5. Let's not reinvent the wheel. Buy projects with roadmaps that have traditionally done well on Solana.

6. Use free tools to make logical assertions. For example, filter average price and see what the biggest gap is between that and floor price.
