About:
•The FatCats Capital Club is focused on community growth, development and innovation. 80% of all mint revenue will be used to grow the Treasury, invest in member run projects through the FatCats Accelerator program while developing exclusive utilities for the Capital Club.

Roadmap

Stage One: Formation of Royal FatCat Partnerships
•We will be forming partnerships to onboard members onto the FatCats Royal Council. Our Royal Council will be composed of 10 members and we aim for it to be filled by some of the brightest, most innovative and influential leaders of the Solana ecosystem. The experience, network and knowledge of our council will allow for the development of some revolutionary member projects via the FatCats Accelerator, in addition to enabling the FCC's access to some of the most exclusive, holistic and informative alpha/literacy content within the entire Solana ecosystem.

Stage Two: Capital Club Creation
•Members will be able to put forth proposals for accelerator projects and if approved, work hand in hand with the FCC's founders and Royal Council to build the next blue chip projects on Solana. Accelerator projects will not only receive funding, but guidance regarding various aspects of their proposed projects (marketing assistance, protocol development, partnership formations, etc.). Members will have governance within the FCC; the ultimate vote to approve accelerator projects will come down to the FCC community. Each holder is a part owner of the Treasury and has governance regarding which member projects are allocated funding. Members will also gain access to exclusive and holistic alpha provided by some of the most successful alpha hunters on Solana. The network of the founders and Royal Council guarantees this. FCC members will be granted exclusive and early whitelist allocations to all FatCats accelerator projects.


Stage Three: Staking for $CATNIP
•$CATNIP will be rewarded to stakers in accordance with our tokenomics outline. $CATNIP will be a community token and will not have any immediate USD value; it can't be exchanged for other crypto-assets. However, the token will have immense utility within the FCC. For example, $CATNIP may be used to enter raffles for FatCat NFTs and other blue chip NFTs held by the FCC, $CATNIP may be used to purchase any future FCC NFT collections, as well as all NFT collections launched via the FatCats Accelerator. Once the FCC transitions to a tokenized DAO, your $CATNIP will be convertible to the $FCGT, the DAO's governance token, which will have monetary value and be exchangeable on DEX's.


Stage Four: Tokenized DAO Formation
•The FCC will transition to a fully tokenized DAO. Operations such as member proposals for accelerator projects as well as member voting and governance will be performed fully on chain. As a fully tokenized and operational DAO, we will be able to perform all FCC operations seamlessly, giving a voice to each and every one of our members. Governance will be determined by one's holdings of the FatCats governance token, $FCGT. $FCGT will be used as the governance currency within the FCC and will be backed by the existing assets within the FCC Treasury. One will be able to convert their holdings of our community token, $CATNIP, to $FCGT and gain access to all future utilities of the token. More details regarding $FCGT tokenomics and utility will be released at a later date, following mint.


Risk: 3/5
•A 3/5 risk rating shows the project's level of potential but there are still things that need to be seen to make sure long term success exists in its current state and only with existing hype converting into stable buying pressure a QF will be possible.
