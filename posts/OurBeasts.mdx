Plan to build
â€¢NFT Aplha Hub Tools
â€¢Mint manager - a better place to manage projects and whitelists. ( ex. a mint reminder will notify you multiple times before an important mint happens)
â€¢Portfolio management - track, manage and get automated alerts notifications when there are big movements in collections you hold


Risk: 3/5
â€¢A 3/5 risk rating shows the project shows level of potential but there are still things that need to be seen to make sure long term success exists in its current state and only with existing hype converting into stable buying pressure a QF will be possible.

1/5 is the lowest risk, 5/5 is the highest
